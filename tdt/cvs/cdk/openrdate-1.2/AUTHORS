20060918 - Well, after a long absence, I've gone and updated the code the latest OBSD version of rdate.
20050211 - It has been my supreme pleasure to turn this piece of OpenBSD software into a package for use by non-OpenBSD users.  All copyrights and licenses are that of the original coder (I abhor borrowed plumage) and have applied my copyright to only the code I've added.  But that being said, all errors and omissions are mine and mine alone.  If you find any, feel free to email at the address below.
